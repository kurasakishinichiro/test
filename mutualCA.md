(i)    not, directly or indirectly, in any way, disclose, make accessible, reveal, report, publish, disseminate or transfer any Confidential Information to any third party;
(ii)    not use any Confidential Information in any manner whatsoever, except in furtherance of the Purpose in accordance with this Agreement;
(iii)    restrict access to Confidential Information to those of its officers, directors, independent contractors, and employees who have a legitimate need-to-know to carry out the Purpose and who are obligated to protect such Confidential Information pursuant to terms and conditions no less protective of Discloser than those contained in this Agreement;

Recipient shall be responsible for any breach of this Agreement by its Affiliates.

## Article 3   Exceptions to Obligations

3.1    Confidential Information does not include any information which:
at the time of disclosure or thereafter is generally available to and known by the public (other than a result of a disclosure directly or indirectly by Recipient or its Affiliates);
was obtained in good faith by Recipient on a non-confidential basis from a source other than Discloser or its advisors, provided that such source is not and was not bound by a confidentiality obligation owed to Discloser;
has been independently acquired or developed by Recipient without reference to Confidential Information received under this Agreement and not in breach of its obligations under this Agreement;
was communicated in response to a valid order by a court or other governmental body, or was otherwise required by law; or 
Discloser has specifically approved in writing for release by Recipient.

3.2    In the event that Recipient becomes legally compelled (by deposition, interrogatory, request for documents, subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar process) to disclose any of the Confidential Information, Recipient shall provide Discloser with prompt written notice of such requirement so that Discloser may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy and/or waive compliance with the terms of this Agreement. In the event that such protective order or other remedy is not obtained, or that Discloser waives compliance with the provisions hereof, Recipient agrees to furnish only that portion of the Confidential Information which is legally required, and such disclosure of Confidential Information by Recipient will not constitute a violation of this Agreement.

3.3    Each Party acknowledges that the Recipient may be independently actively engaged, by itself or with third parties, in the development of products, content or businesses that may be similar to some of Discloser’s Confidential Information, and may continue to engage in such development after the discussions between the Parties contemplated by this Agreement. Accordingly, nothing in this Agreement will be construed as a representation or inference that Recipient will not develop products, or have products developed for it, that, without violation of this Agreement, compete with the products or systems contemplated by Discloser's Confidential Information. Should a dispute arise, the Recipient must present evidence that adequate procedures and policies are in place with regard to any employee or Affiliate who was involved at any stage of the independent development activities in order to (i) prohibit such employee or Affiliate from any connection to or access to the Discloser’s Confidential Information and (ii) banning discussions with such employee or Affiliate regarding the Discloser’s Confidential Information.

## Article 4   Return and Destruction of Confidential Information

At any time Discloser so requests and automatically upon termination or expiration of this Agreement, Recipient shall promptly return to Discloser all copies of the Confidential Information and/or Derivatives in its possession or in the possession of its Affiliates. Further, Recipient shall destroy all copies of any analyses, compilations, studies or other documents prepared by Recipient containing or reflecting any Confidential Information and/or Derivatives. Notwithstanding the return of Confidential Information, both Parties shall continue to be bound by the obligations of confidentiality hereunder.

## Article 5    Injunctive Relief

Each Party recognizes that unauthorized disclosure of Confidential Information by Recipient will diminish the value of the proprietary interests and cause irreparable damage to Discloser. In such case, money damages will be inadequate to compensate Discloser; and Discloser will be entitled to injunctive relief against such unauthorized disclosure of Confidential Information, in addition to, and in no way a limitation of, any and all other remedies Discloser may have in law or in equity against Recipient for enforcement of this Agreement.

## Article 6    Ownership of Confidential Information and Derivatives

6.1    All Confidential Information and any Derivatives thereof, whether created by Discloser or Recipient, remain the property of Discloser. No license or other rights to Confidential Information or Derivatives is granted or implied hereby.

6.2    Recipient hereby does and shall assign to Discloser all of Recipient’s rights, title-in-interest, and interest in and to the Derivatives. All materials (including, without limitation, documents, drawings, models, apparatus, sketches, designs, lists, and all other tangible media of expression) furnished to Recipient by Discloser will remain the property of Discloser.

Each of the Parties understands that neither Party nor its Affiliates makes any representation or warranty as to the accuracy or completeness of the Confidential Information, or any other information which a Party furnishes to the other Party orally or in writing. Each Party agrees that neither Party nor its Affiliates shall have any liability to the other Party or its Affiliates resulting from the use of the Confidential Information by such Party or its Affiliates or for any errors therein or omissions therein.

## Article 8   No Obligation

Each of the Parties reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to terminate the discussions for the Purpose contemplated by this Agreement. Other than the confidentiality obligations set forth herein, neither Party shall be obligated to the other Party under this Agreement unless and until the Parties enter into a properly executed written agreement with respect thereto, and then only according to all of the terms of said agreement. No fiduciary relationship exists between the Parties, and none is created by any discussions between the Parties or by the execution of this Agreement.

## Article 9   Term and Termination
